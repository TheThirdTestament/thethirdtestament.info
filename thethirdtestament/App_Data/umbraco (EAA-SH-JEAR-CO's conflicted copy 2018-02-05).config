        <intro><![CDATA[<p><span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">The Third Testament is the continuation of The New Testament and The Old Testament. It is based on the cosmic analyses as described by Martinus in his major publications: Livets Bog (The Book of Life), The Eternal World Picture, and supplementary works.</span></p>]]></intro>
        <content><![CDATA[<div>At the age of 30 Martinus receives a spiritual experience that gives him cosmic consciousness and enables him to fulfil what Jesus promised his disciples:</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="quote">”I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you to the whole truth”. - Paul said: “For we know in part...But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away...but then shall I know even as also I am known.”</span></div>
<div><br />The Third Testament not only presents in part the truths, more or less expressed in The Bible and other Holy Scriptures, but describes in full a new world picture. It is a total explanation that shows a logical and loving purpose to existence. It is a defense for everything and everyone and provides an  optimistic view of life.</div>
<div><br />The Third Testament shows that behind the apparent illogical content of the world religions, clear intellectual perspectives exist.</div>
<div><br />Each individual is responsible for their own evaluation of the level of truth in The Third Testament. Nobody should be tied to anything but their own interpretation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Third Testament shows that, among others:</div>
<ul>
<li>The universe constitutes a living being – the Godhead.</li>
<li>Every living being has an eternally continuing existence.</li>
<li>In the eternal perspective evolution will show that: “everything is very good”.</li>
<li>Life is 100% fair due to reincarnation and karma.</li>
<li>The purpose of existence is to experience life, develop neighborly love and tolerance towards everything and everybody.</li>
<li>Evolution causes eternal renewal of the experience of life.</li>
<li>The contrasts of light and darkness, pleasantness and unpleasantness, good and evil, etc. are absolutely indispensible to continual renewal of consciousness.</li>
<li>The individual human being will, due to life experiences, eventually live in harmony with the eternal laws of life.</li>
<li>It is logical to behave with tolerance towards all living beings.</li>
<li>True neighborly love is, unconditionally and always, to forgive everything and everyone.</li>
<li>Its message is a defense of everything and everybody.</li>
<li>Nobody can act “unrighteously” and nobody can suffer “unrighteously”. Everyone will at some point experience a completely happy existence.</li>
<li>The Third Testament world picture is illustrated with a series of symbols. Their purpose are to show the principles and structures of life, making it easier to get an overview, understand and retain in consciousness.</li>
<li>The Third Testament, Martinus Spiritual Science also called the science of universal love, is entirely in concordance with the proven results of natural science.<br /> </li>
</ul>
<h3>What is it not</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is not the basis for the formation of a new faith-based society, sect or association enrolling new members.</li>
<li>There are no ceremonial acts or illogical dogmas related to it.</li>
<li>It does not promote aggression against nor critique of anyone with a different view.</li>
<li>It is not meant to influence people against their own interests and passions.</li>
</ul>

        <intro><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of The Third Testament is to raise the great questions about life out of the hazy area of belief into personal experience and well founded knowledge. The basic premise of the work is that the mystery of life can be explained scientifically.</p>]]></intro>
        <content><![CDATA[<h2>An inner journey of discovery</h2>
<div>A study of The Third Testament offers an enormous journey of discovery into our inner world. By means of logical chains of thought, we are guided out of the transitory world of matter into the innermost wellspring of life. Here we discover that we are all immortal and that our innermost self is eternal and infinite. We discover that we all share the same vital core. We discover that everything around us is living, whether “down” in micro cosmos or “up” in macro cosmos. Before our eyes we watch in amazement as the universe is transformed from a mass of dead matter, governed by pure chance, into something that we can sense as an all-embracing, living, thinking organism, which has existed in all eternity. We discover that all of us in all eternity live, move and have our being within this organism. We discover the laws of love that guarantee this living, conscious organism’s eternal life. We begin to be able to see our short life on Earth in the perspective of eternity.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>The eternal questions about life</h2>
<div>The title: “The Third Testament” can of course cause surprise. What are the two other testaments of which The Third Testament is a continuation? Once this has become clear we can see straight away what topics are under discussion. A continuation of The Old and The New Testaments will naturally deal with the eternal questions, Who am I?, Where have I come from? and Where am I going to?. It should provide an explanation of the periods of suffering in life and thereby clarify the road to harmony and happiness. – But who can with justification be called upon to write a continuation of the Bible? It can only be someone who like Christ has firsthand knowledge of the eternal questions.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Livets Bog</h2>
<div>The main work in The Third Testament is called Livets Bog (The Book of Life) and the Danish title is used in all languages). The universe can be likened to a book. The universe is the “book of books”, the source of all knowledge. Everyone is reading it, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, scientists as well as writers and artists, yes, even plants and animals. We all interact with all the forces that surround us.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The purpose of “Livets Bog” is to help us read directly in the real book - Nature. We are all born into this, there are no admission ceremonies. The Third Testament does not create a new religion, it teaches us to understand the speech of life itself, life’s own religion. The aim of The Third Testament is to show how loving our neighbour and God is the highest science in life. God being understood as an all-embracing living being, synonymous with the universe. The question of eternity is placed under the magnifying glass and analysed in the bright light of intuition. As mankind is increasingly moving away from the stage of blind belief, verifiable facts are needed - also regarding life’s spiritual questions.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>The Third Testament is the fulfilment of Christ’s prophecies</h2>
<div>That this knowledge should come to mankind has been predicted. In The New Testament we can read: “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.” (John 16:12) “The Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.” (John 14:25-26) “...and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counsellor to be with you forever - the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him.” (John 14:16-17)</div>
<div></div>
<div>What is needed in order to be able to experience spiritual realities In order to gain knowledge in the spiritual area it is not enough to have a well-developed intelligence or analytical ability, a humane disposition is also needed. Only when both the intellect and the humaneness have reached a state of maturity does the psychic transformation come about that makes it possible for us to experience spiritual realities. It is this mental balance that gave Martinus, the author of The Third Testament, an absolutely certain knowledge of those areas of life that are normally completely unknown.</div>]]></content>

        <mainContent><![CDATA[<div>Martinus lived in the country of the great storyteller, Hans Christian Andersen had the ability to make a fairy tale out of reality. One might say the opposite about Martinus; he made the “fairy tale” into reality. He transformed the eternal essence of the religions, the message of limitless love, into spiritual science!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Martinus was born in 1890 in Sindal, North Jutland, Denmark where he grew up with his foster parents on a small farm. He received no education apart from elementary schooling. His wish to become a school teacher could not be fulfilled because of poor economic circumstances. Instead, he became a farm hand, a dairy worker, a steward, a night watchman, a postman and an office clerk in Copenhagen.<br /> </div>
<div>The following are Martinus’ own words from the manuscript to the book, “The Intellectualised Christianity”:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“In my thirty-first year I experienced a spiritual process that led me to a cosmic mission. It was an evening in March 1921, and I was sitting in complete darkness in my room at Nørrebros Runddel in Copenhagen with my attention concentrated on God. It was while I was concentrating on God in this total darkness that I experienced, in an awake day-conscious cosmic vision, my divine calling, which was totally incomprehensible to me at that time. This calling was to use intuition to explain and manifest as cosmic science the “much” that Jesus could have told his disciples, but which neither they nor the official authorities of the time were evolved enough to understand.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“...The vision of Christ that I experienced was not a dream or a hallucination, but a fully awake, day-conscious, cosmic experience, and it contained a distinct declaration of a mission that I was to carry out. ... The very next morning, I felt that I had to meditate once again. After having made myself comfortable in my wicker-chair, which I now found to be charged with a form of powerful spiritual energy, I tied a towel over my eyes and found myself thus in complete darkness, but in an absolutely awake, day-conscious state. At once it was as if I saw into a semi-darkened sky over which a dark shadow was moving, leaving the sky brighter. This shadow passed over the sky several times, each time the sky becoming ever brighter until it was a blinding ocean of light, the color of purest gold, brighter than any other light in existence. It took the form of thousands of vibrating, vertical golden threads that totally filled the space.</div>
<div> <br />I found myself alone in the midst of this divine, living expanse of golden light, but without myself having any visible appearance whatsoever. I had no organism, just as all created things around me, my room, my furniture, indeed, the entire material world, had completely disappeared or were beyond the reach of my senses.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Despite the fact that the blinding golden light, with its vibrating radiant threads of gold, had absorbed into itself everything that is otherwise accessible to the senses or the experience of life, I could nevertheless through this dazzling golden light experience in a day-conscious way that I had a living existence beyond the physical world, beyond everything that would normally appear to be created phenomena. I was outside time and space. I was one with infinity and eternity. I was in the element of my immortal I, the immortal I that together with the immortal I’s of all living beings in existence is one with the I or eternal origin of the universe. I was one with what had been sought and worshipped, both consciously and unconsciously, by all the world’s cultures, religions, races and peoples since time immemorial – the eternal, almighty, all-wise and all-loving Godhead.”</div>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>Martinus explains what happend during his golden baptism of fire 1921:</p>
<div>“I did not get through the book in question and little it was that I remember from its contents; but it had the effect of making me meditate on God. And one evening, when I tried to do so, I had the following experience, after which, for psychical reasons, it was quite impossible for me to go on reading, for from that moment my own consciousness had become an inexhaustible spiritual fountain, rendering absolutely superfluous all study of literature.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>[...]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Following the direction given in the borrowed book I, one evening tried to meditate on the concept "God". And suddenly, without knowing exactly how, I found myself in a condition that made me feel in the presence of something immensely sublime. Quite a small luminous point appeared in the distance. For a moment it disappeared, but shortly after became visible again, this time much nearer. I could now see that the light emanated from a Christ-like being, presenting itself in a dazzling white light, spangled with shades of blue. The light was so intense and vivid that it reminded me of those sparklers we used to put on Christmas trees. The sparks in my revelation, however, were diminutive in comparison, but in return much more numerous.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There was once more a pause, during which I found myself in complete darkness. But then the figure a new illuminated the plateau. I looked directly into a fiery figure. A Christ-like being of dazzling brightness now moved straight towards me, raising its arms as if about to embrace me. I was entirely paralyzed. Unable to make the slightest move, I gazed straight into the radiant being's diaphragm, now just outside of me and on a level with my eyes. But the figure kept closing in, and presently it entered my own flesh and blood. A sublime feeling thrilled me. The paralysis left me. The divine light, which had thus taken possession of me, enabled me to take a sweeping look throughout the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And lo! continents and oceans, cities and countries, mountains and valleys - all steeped in the light now emanating from my own mind. In this, white light the earth was transfigured into "the Kingdom of God".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The divine experience was over. I had once more before me my physical reality, the details of my room, the modesty of my position. But "the Kingdom of God" kept illuminating my brain and my nerves.<br /><br /></div>
<h2>The golden baptism of fire</h2>
<div>When on the morning of the following day I seated myself in my meditation-chair, I was again at once enveloped in the divine light. I looked into a bright, blue heaven, which seemed to be drawn aside, by which a still brighter heaven appeared. And thus it kept on, until a heaven came out so exuberantly dazzling in its golden flare and vibrating at such a velocity that I felt myself at the summit of what my organism and my mind could endure. A single step, a single fraction of a second more, and the celestial oscillation would, with the immense power of lightning, in the twinkling of an eye have put an end to my earthly existence. But during the fractions of a second that the revelation lasted I experienced a world of holiness, purity, harmony, and perfection. I found myself in a sea of light. This was not, as in my first revelation, white as snow, but was rather of a golden tinge. Everything was fire of a golden lustre. Throughout were vibrating thin, golden filaments, glittering here and there, within and without. I felt that this was the very consciousness of God, his own sphere of thought. It was the substance, the omnipotence, the supreme power, through which the divine ego ruled and directed oceans of worlds, galaxies, and nebulae, in microcosmos as well as in macrocosmos. I was spell-bound. The divine fire vibrated within me and without, above and below. "The Spirit of God". which according to the Bible "moved upon the face of the waters", the "fire" that Moses saw burning in the thorn-bush, the "fire" that took Elijah into Heaven, the "fire" through which Jesus was transfigured on the mountain, the "fire" that appeared above the heads of the apostles, and subsequently changed Saulus into Paulus on his way to Damascus, the "fire" that throughout all times has been the "alpha" and "omega" in every form of sublime creation, manifestation, or revelation. It was this very fire blazing in front of my own eyes, vibrating in my own breast, in my own heart, enveloping my whole being. I felt as if bathing in an element of love. I was at the origin, the very source of everything warm in a father's and mother's sympathy for their offspring, of mutual devotion in the amours of a young couple. I saw the power that made the hand sign the letter of pardon, abolish slavery, protect life's petty ones, whether it be a little animal or a frail human being. I saw the sunshine that can melt the ice and remove the cold from every mind, transform the barren deserts of hopelessness and pessimism into fertile and sunny regions of consciousness, warm the heart, inspire the brain, thus making the individual forgive injustice, love his enemy, and understand the criminal. It was as if I was resting at the bosom of the Almighty Deity. I was dwelling at the fountain head of love supreme, perceived divine perfection, experienced being one with the Way, the Truth, and the Life, was one with the Father of all.”</div>

        <content><![CDATA[<h2>1. The end of feeling secure</h2>
<div>Is there anyone for whom the daily existence is absolutely stable, completely happy? If a person were to answer this question honestly and sincerely on the basis of his own experience or that of others it would have to be: “No!” People are not happy. They are sometimes happier than at other times, but it is not any stable feeling of security or state of happiness.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This instability finds expression in as many ways as there are people. It can start as early as childhood. A little child may be born to good and loving parents, nursed and cared for under the most wonderful conditions and thus apparently have the very best possibilities for experiencing a happy childhood and start in life. But suddenly the mother dies, and the father remarries; and with the new stepmother conditions in the home are changed. The time before the mother died will seem as a lost happiness for the child; it cannot develop a good and confident relationship with it’s new mother and it feels that it’s security in life is gone. The atmosphere in the home has been poisoned. There may be many reasons for this. It may not be the fault of the stepmother. For the child it may mean a certain distortion of its attitude towards life, a negativity that will follow it the rest of its life, if it is unable to overcome it. There are many other ways one may lose the feeling of security and happiness in childhood. When people view their childhood as an especially secure and happy period of their life, it is often because it stands out as a radiant contrast to events in their later life, with insecurity, pain and disappointment.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>2. No man is immune to unhappiness</h2>
<div>Many people feel security and happiness for a while when they are in love, engaged or on their honeymoon. This happiness may be of shorter or longer duration. but then it may break down. The cause may be death, illness or an accident, or one partner falling in love with someone else, or something else entirely. No matter what the cause, the feeling of security and happiness is gone. Catastrophe, sorrow and pain have taken its place. These factors are often followed by fear and mistrust of everything and every one and disappointment in finding that the happiness could not last. Older people who have had a relatively happy existence may also be hit by grief and misfortune in their old age. It hits much harder if that person has led a pampered existence.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Who can be sure that he is completely invulnerable, completely tree of or immune to misfortune? No one can be sure. Some think that wealth and power protect them and they fight to attain these benefits. But sooner or later they come to the realization that happiness cannot be purchased and that the one who seems powerful, confident and great is exactly as powerless as everyone else in life’s manifestation of fate. The millionaires and billionaires and whoever in other ways are the “great people” of the world must also experience the feeling of insecurity, e.g. by the fear of suddenly no longer being great and of losing their power and position. The lifestyle of such people often exposes them to fatal illnesses much more easily than people who cannot afford to eat and drink so much. Their idleness or contrarily their overexertion to stay on top causes bad nerves, also producing illness. Finally wealth and power cannot relieve anybody of sorrows experienced in relations with family and friends, who die suddenly, unrequited love, disappointment over the children and much more. The wealthy have their sorrows and worries and the less well off as well as the poor have theirs. Some have the misfortune as a sudden breakdown, others slide in to it little by little, but no one escapes experiencing it in some way.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>3. The apparent injustice of life</h2>
<div>But what about people who consider themselves saved or holy? Are they an exception? The exception is not that they avoid misfortune, sorrow and suffering. Even if they go to church every Sunday, take communion regularly and in other ways follow the dogma and prescriptions of a church, a sect or religion they are still as likely to be among the patients in the hospitals as their “unsaved” or “sinful” fellow citizens. And does not even a believer in time of distress say: “Why should this happen to me?” He thought that he could feel secure in his “holiness”, but he experienced something quite different. And then the question is if he can avoid becoming bitter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Life would be most unjust, as many people think it is, if belonging to a certain race, a faith, a social group, a particular age group or sex would predestine some people to be happier than others. But that is because they see and evaluate conditions from a momentary situation, the causes and effects of which they do not know. The world is not unjust! No man experiences more suffering, pain and sorrow than any other, even though it may appear so. To understand this is a part of the road to lasting happiness. But there is more to it than that! Is it really possible for man to achieve an existence without sorrow and suffering, without disappointment and bitterness, without sickness, privation or pain? Yes, it is possible! And it is also possible for the individual to start right now to create that condition, i.e. to create the causes that will effect such a condition sometime in the future.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>4. A growing knowledge of cause and effect</h2>
<div>Terrestrial man in general and researchers in particular know a great deal about the relationship between cause and effect. It is just such knowledge that helps separate terrestrial humanity from the animals. But terrestrial man’s knowledge of cause-and effect-relationships - also in regard to scientific knowledge - is still very scant. It is concentrated in small local areas and in the relationship to physical matter. It is, how ever, a start, and when man has had enough experience, it will go far, indeed, it will actually lead him to the experience of true happiness.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It may sound strange, when one thinks of the same humanity’s present situation when wars, revolutions, abuse of power, murder, crimes and all kinds of mental aberration are more rampant than at any time in history. But who has created the cause of these conditions? Terrestrial human beings themselves have done it. And who is capable of creating causes that will result in completely different and new conditions? Also terrestrial human beings themselves. But one cannot expect them to do it. One cannot expect that the Russians, Americans, Chinese or any other people suddenly will be interested only in creating peace. No, one cannot, even though the statesmen and politicians say that that is what they want. But is the situation hopeless then? No, there is not only hope, there is certainty that mankind will emerge from all its misfortune and pain and suffering. People in general are just not able to see it and know what they should do; they are still without knowledge of the laws of life and thus of the causes that will bring the peace and happiness as effects. They have certainly been told, not least by Christ who, with his life and his death and with his example has shown them what is the way, the truth and the life. But they did not understand him. They built up a religion of dogma and ceremony with the doctrine of atonement, salvation and happiness after death for the believers, and eternal damnation and the torment of hell for the infidels. No one can be blamed for this. For human beings must act on the basis of their understanding, knowledge and insight. They must act according to the stage of development at which they have arrived. They cannot think and act any differently. But that does not mean that Christianity has not had tremendous significance for the development of mankind, especially here in the West.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>5. Christianity and people of our time</h2>
<div>When one looks at the fact that the so-called Christian nations have been the most ingenious warriors of the world, one cannot blame someone who has started to think about things and conditions in life, for having the view that Christianity has been in vain. It is not exactly a feeling of security and happiness that the Christian peoples have created for others, i.e. they have not created the causes that would result in happiness and a feeling of security. But concurrent with the Western development of war machinery and violent domination by which the people of other continents were made slaves or partially eradicated, something else developed in the West. This is so far the greatest result of Christianity, even though it is not immediately apparent. It is the development of humane feelings in the individual people and the creation of humanistic enterprises in all the states and nations. Neither the humane and loving individuals nor the humane institutions, it is true, are numerous or strong enough to exert a decisive influence on the world situation. But they are on their way. And Christianity has absolutely not ended its influence; on the contrary, it is now really going to work, because more people have matured to grasp its importance and to combine it with their own way of living.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But is Christianity formulated in such a way that humanely inclined people in the present and in the future can be inspired by its spiritual content and world of ideas? No, the real content of Christianity is disguised or hidden behind an outer form that was created by the patriarchs and theologians of ancient and medieval times. This form does absolutely not suit people of today, who are influenced by the scientific and technical development. They have also become so materialistic in all areas that they have a difficult time imagining what spirit really is. But this obstacle for the further development of Christianity is about to be removed for a science of spirit. A spiritual science is being created, through which terrestrial man will obtain a much greater overview of the relationship between cause and effect. As he through spiritual science develops insight into the causes of the present situation of humanity. man can also acquire the knowledge of how it can be changed in the long term. And what is very important — he will learn to understand that the individual, humanely thinking human being can actually do something to change the world situation and that he does not have to wait for all the others to do it.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>6. The business principle seen in two perspectives</h2>
<div>One of the bearing principles of life in our time is the business principle. This principle has been of enormous importance for the development of the entire western civilization and culture. The business principle is also an expression of an understanding of the relationship between cause and effect. The businessman learns that if certain causes have such effects his business pays. The same businessman, however, is often very materialistically inclined and so egotistical that he only thinks of whether the business at this very moment is profitable for him. He may think only very little or not at all that it may harm, indeed may even be an irreplaceable loss to the other party. There fore this so-called businessman is absolutely not a businessman at all, if we observe him in a larger perspective, a cosmic perspective. Why not? Because he is instrumental in creating a cause that some time in the future will have the following effects on him: irreplaceable loss, bankruptcy or another form of crash or breakdown. What in a small local perspective “pays”, does absolutely not pay in reality and in the long run. The entire business world is therefore, as it manifests itself today, preparing its own destruction. But the terrestrial human beings do not know the connection between cause and effect in the long term. And how can they acquire such knowledge? Even if a spiritual science that can explain it is created, most people do not know it and may not even want to know it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Only few people are interested in spiritual science and in the knowledge of the laws of life. It will not remain so in the future. And what will be the driving force? Misfortune, feelings of insecurity, suffering, pain and all the apparently insurmountable difficulties to which people are exposed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The cosmic structure of the business principle consists of giving equal value for equal value, an exchange to the advantage of both parties. Even though it appears foolish to a modern business man, it is, however, also where business is concerned, better to give than to take, as Christ said. So it must be emphasized that until one acquires that attitude in the business world as well as in life in general, one will not be able to experience true happiness. In our time we champion the principle: it is better to take than to give; it is also called profit, and even though a lot of good and respectable business exists, the tendency is more and more in the direction that a few — whether they be people or states — will possess the means and the power and will exploit the many, who are more or less the dispossessed. This is not a criticism of business people but a characterisation and analysis of the world situation. For the states are also businesses that are to be run for profit, and wars are one of the means that are used when assets are at stake.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>7. Misfortune and pain are a Golgotha process</h2>
<div>What is it that people have sown through an egotistical, short-sighted exploitation of the business principle? They have sown something that absolutely does not pay. And this they have to learn. And they can learn this only by experiencing the effects of their actions, and that is what they are doing now. People must learn what pays for mankind and not just for the moment, but in the long run. Some people have started to acquire such knowledge. They are, among others, those who could accept the ethical and love oriented content of religion without caring significantly about the limitations of the outer form. But why were some people more receptive than others? Indeed, why was one robber on Golgotha open and positive towards Christ, and the other not? Because the first had learned from life and the suffering and the misfortune that had developed sympathy and love in his mind, while the other was still tough and hardened. All of mankind is actually like the two robbers on each side of Christ. Some more like the one, others more like the other. And all of humanity is also crucified. It is a Golgotha process that we see when we view a dark fate. Man’s physical body is the “cross” on which his dark consciousness is being destroyed. It is those dark tendencies that must succumb by being nailed to the cross. That the “cross” is flesh and blood, of animal nature, does not alter the principle. All misfortune, suffering, pain, sorrow and disappointment that a person is exposed to in the physical world is that person’s “crucifixion”. It is not punishment from an angry god and it is not the result of chance. It is everything from the person’s past that he or she at the time thought would “pay”, which now turns out not to. But through this experience, this person will gradually learn what in human terms does pay, and eventually do it. It is an education in becoming human. Through Christ and the two robbers mankind has been given three examples of how a crucifixion can be borne by people on three different stages on the road of life. First the “evil” robber. He is meeting an effect of his deeds; but he is still hardened and full of scorn and mockery towards Christ. But he is not evil, he is ignorant and primitive. He has started the education where he is going to learn what in human terms will pay. The “good” robber is good because he has already learned a great deal. Indeed, so much that he can say to the other: “We are receiving the due reward for our deeds, but this man (Christ) has done nothing wrong”. This robber is a being who is well on his way on the road to true happiness, even though he is still far from having reached it. The being on the middle cross has reached it. And it is right what the robber says about him: “This man has done nothing wrong”. For Christ the crucifixion was not instruction in what cosmically and humanly pays. He knew that.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>8. Happiness and world redemption</h2>
<div>His kingdom was not of this world where there is sorrow, disappointment, sickness, hardship and all kinds of misery. He had all that far behind him. Now it was his mission to show terrestrial mankind that happiness, for which it longs so much, is achieved only by a certain form of behaviour that creates such causes and effects that are a joy, a benefit and a blessing for its surroundings. It was not his mission to appease an angry god and atone for the “sins” of mankind. All so-called sin is lack of knowledge of cause and effect and of other cosmic laws; and it is surely not sinful to be ignorant. Christ could therefore say of his persecutors and his executioners: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do”. The “redemption” of the world does not consist of freeing people from the effect of their faulty way of being through divine ”grace”. Then they would never become better or wiser; it would mean a stop in their development; it would be most unkind. And as the Godhead is the culmination of love he does not allow any beings to be “saved” by his “grace” and others to be “lost” by his “anger”.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All knowledge is the effect of actions and all real wise and holy men and women who have lived on this earth have attained their insight and ability to love through the experiences of suffering in many physical lives. They have learned what humanly pays. But when all living beings, through their experiences of cause and effect, will reach the greatest possible development of their consciousness, the greatest possible knowledge and the most exalted artistic talent, why do they need Christ? Why did he have to suffer death on the cross for the sake of mankind? Because mankind had to have an example in view; a person, who with his own life showed how it is possible to renounce those realities or causes of which darkness is the effect. How he, even though he meets the darkness, does not respond with darkness, but on the contrary with his practical manner of being, expresses such a love for everything and everybody that the nearness of God is felt not only in the light but also in the darkness. “You shall love those who hate and persecute you”, said Christ and he showed that this was possible. He expressed clearly, that mankind’s acquisition of the behaviour and way of being of this world redeemer as its one and only “salvation”, with the words: “And he who does not bear his cross and follow me, he cannot be my disciple”.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>9. The continuation of Christianity</h2>
<div>Every single human being experiences, as previously mentioned, a crucifixion when he or she is exposed to misery, adversity, pain, disappointment, sickness and defeat in one form or another. And then the question is: how does he react to what is happening? In most cases the reaction is: bitterness, depression or anger. But Christ did not react that way. True, he did cry out: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” That was a state of mind that he overcame in the very next moment. He died without anything negative whatsoever in his mind. But that is impossible, people say. He could do that, but others cannot. Therefore dogmas have been created to the effect that he took on the “sins” of man, so one just had to believe, to convert, to repent one’s sins etc. One made Christ the scapegoat instead of a model for human behaviour, because one thought that the model was far too remote from the common man. But in the first place a model must be perfect, and in the second place quite a number of people now are not as remote from the model as people were at the time of Christ. Thirdly, Christianity as a world impulse was not concluded with the life and death of Christ on this planet. He showed us by his manner of being, and with his pronouncements, his parables and the sermon on the mount, he gave expression for the great answers in life. And now when humanity is gradually beginning to become sufficiently mature, the impulse continues in such a way that a spiritual science gives the analyses of the great truths that Christ brought us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It has become my mission to give humanity a series of analyses that together form a world picture, a revelation of the laws of life and the divine world plan. And this cosmology is at the same time a continuation of physical science and its limited overview of cause and effect relationships. And it is an education in what, from a humane point of view, pays and a disclaimer of the business principle as it is practised in our day. Cosmology is not to be a fashion movement that spreads with great speed across the world. It will spread steadily and quietly from person to person in the coming time, to the people that need it.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>10. A new attitude to life</h2>
<div>And who needs spiritual science? It is those people in whose consciousness sorrow, suffering and disappointment have awakened sympathy for others who have difficulties. That is, people whose feelings have developed to an ability to love not just one being of the opposite sex but the beings in the surroundings altogether. These feelings do not make them sentimental because at the same time their ability to think and acquire an overview of cause and effect has also developed. These people have matured sufficiently to think logically not only in physical but also in spiritual fields. And there will be more and more of such people in the future. This will result in a change of course in the scientific direction in the mental and spiritual fields. However, it is not a science reserved for people with a certain education. The people who are receptive to cosmic logic are the people that life itself has educated. They are those who have been through great difficulties and have started to feel what absolutely does not pay.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A new form of security will grow in the minds of these people. They will no longer fear death for they will learn that there is no death, only a change from one condition to another, a transformation through reincarnation or rebirth, which in itself is a development. And this development will, in time, lead man to a condition that is true happiness, as he will be devoid of the feeling of insecurity, of disappointment and of all forms of misery that currently plague humanity of our time. This coming condition will be achieved neither through miracles nor through “atonement” of an angry God. The Godhead is the first to know that no being at the moment can be any different than it is. People will acquire this knowledge. And it will help them to forgive their neighbour and not demand that he should think or act based on experience that he has not yet had. But when it is against oneself that “injustice” is done? Then it means something to have understood the law of cause and effect in the perspective of the formation of fate and of reincarnation. When one knows that nothing else can happen to one than that to which one is oneself the ultimate cause, and that one in this or a prior incarnation has oneself sown the fate that one is now reaping, then there is no one to be angry at. The others one previously criticized and hated, despise and scorned are seen as tools used by providence, so that one reaps, through them, as one has sown. Not as punishment, but as instruction and education in what pays and what does not pay, if one wants to become human. Happiness is achieved little by little through the transformation that occurs in the human being’s mind. For real happiness is a state of mind independent of outer circumstances.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>11. From “crucifixion” to “resurrection”</h2>
<div>The history of terrestrial man is really a history of the crucifixion, because every time a human being incarnates anew in physical matter or gets a new physical body, its consciousness is “nailed” to the “cross” that the mentioned body constitutes. But could man not develop by just living in spiritual worlds without the physical incarnation? No, until man has really learned to think in accordance with the laws of life he must incarnate in physical matter because it is the only cosmic sphere in which it hurts to think wrongly. And it is this instruction and this education that eventually will teach him to think correctly. No part whatsoever of the adversity and the difficulties that you may meet has been caused by any one other than your self. That goes for sorrows and disappointments and it goes for sickness. But if you try to bear your fate with patience, where it cannot be changed, and work with yourself by changing your habits little by little in a more humane direction, you will notice how the feeling of security and happiness will surface from within yourself. Your happiness should not be dependent on another person’s attitude towards you, but on your own attitude toward that person and toward your surroundings altogether. You can gradually change your attitude from unwillingness, envy, jealousy, irritation, anger, bitterness and sourness to willingness and friendliness and understand that no one can be any different than they are at this moment and that it is not your concern to change them. Life will take care of that. What is your concern is to be instrumental in transforming yourself, and even though it is difficult, the model tor “the real human being” or “man in the image of God”, Christ, has also taught you a method that can he of great help — and that is prayer. Through your relationship with the eternal Godhead you will gradually achieve an inner feeling of security that will help you in any situation whatsoever. Then your “crucifixion” is about to become your “resurrection”, then your cruciform organism will be come a light centre of love, and happiness will be something created by your thoughts and actions and presence. It will be something you sow; and as a man sows, so shall he also reap.</div>

        <content><![CDATA[<h2>Death will stop being a mystery</h2>
<div>Something that must be a fact for all people, when they think about it, is that they must die some day. Most people do not think about it except when they, through the death of friends or relatives, come closer to life than usual, and then the thought strikes them with terror. Death is a riddle to most people. "No one has come back and told how it is on the other side, and perhaps there is no 'other side' at all", people usually say. It is therefore natural that I, in my lectures, deal with, among other things, the mystery of death, which will gradually stop being something about which people feel anxious or terrified.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What then is death? First and foremost it is an experience that comes to absolutely all physical beings in this world. No one doubts that they will have to experience it as it is too apparent in all things around us. Furthermore, death is not only a process that will come some day; it is already present within us. You began to die when you were born. Where is the tiny baby's body in which you came to the world? Where is the little child's face with which you in excited expectation looked forward to Christmas Eve, the little face that shone both when you, as a child, heard the wonderful adventure of Christmas and when you experienced all the other happy hours of childhood?</div>
<div>This face does not exist any more on the physical plane. You have another face now. And if you are an old person today one can ask where the young and agile body with which you embraced the one you loved is now. And where is the mature body with which you crowned your life's work and experienced the peak of your physical appearance in this life? These bodies are, if you are today an old man or woman, long since dead. The old person has actually already experienced reincarnation or rebirth several times before he or she has to die.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>The transformation of the organism</h2>
<div>It cannot be denied that these physical bodies no longer exist. Here you will perhaps argue that an older person's present body is the same as the body the person in question had as a child and as a young person, only now it is worn out. But such a view is based on an illusion. An organism is a "living thing", an organisation of living micro-individuals that we call organs, cells, molecules and atoms. With the exception of the organs, the cycles of these micro-individuals are so quick that their physical existence is of a far shorter duration than that of the macro-being. These beings are therefore continuously replaced in the organism of the macro-being. Every minute there are cells and atoms that are born and die in our organism, so our organism is in fact subject to a continuous process of transformation and in the course of only a few months is almost totally renewed. So it is not an insignificant number of bodies an older person has already left behind. Every renewal must be perceived as a new body. But you do not notice these reincarnations or rebirths much since, behind these transformations, you go on with a continuous, uninterrupted experience of life. The replacement takes place gradually and in such a gentle and harmonious way that it does not normally disturb or interrupt the experience of life. But if one imagines that the replacement of these micro-beings took place at the same time the organism would have to die and an entirely new organism would have to replace it. A kind of death process would then have to take place between these replacements. The body we had as a child would then be unchangeable until that moment when we were mature enough to take possession of the body we had as a youth, and the concept of "growing'', in the sense in which we know it, would be unknown to us. The replacement that could not happen gradually must then happen suddenly. We would have to fall into a kind of sleep or hibernation, and during this sleep the new body, which should bear our youth-consciousness, would have to grow quickly and the child-body would just as quickly have to shrivel up and be discarded in favour of the new. We would then wake up in a new body and use it for a period until a new replacement should take place.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are in fact beings in this physical world who experience their renewal of life according to this principle, namely various insects who go through the caterpillar, chrysalis and butterfly stages. These beings must experience a kind of death-process between each of the stages within each local terrestrial life. Imagine if we had to go through the same! One fine day we would be overwhelmed by an intense desire to sleep deeply, and the body by which our relatives and friends were used to identifying us would shrivel up and wither, and a new body would grow in its place. The day-consciousness would thereby again be able to manifest itself and we would wake up in a new, beautiful body that no one would recognise as ''us". Indeed, we could even participate in the burial of our recently discarded body. For some people all this will sound comical, for others perhaps alarming, but there are however beings in the universe and even on this planet that experience the physical renewal of life according to such a principle.<br /> </div>
<h2>The replacement of the organisms of terrestrial human beings</h2>
<div>I have touched on all of this only because it in reality lifts a first little corner of the veil that covers the process that people call "death" and that is so often terrifying for them. But the human being has no cause to be afraid of death other than those causes he himself creates. And through spiritual science the modern seeker has the possibility to make himself familiar with what happens during the process of death so that the anxiety and uncertainty can be overcome and be replaced by confidence and security. It is quite true that after the death process with which people are familiar there is only the discarded physical body or corpse left. One is not able to see the being appear in a new form. But is this an unshakeable proof that the consciousness is wiped out on the decomposition of the organism? No - we can only physically experience another person's consciousness when this other person has a physical body through which to manifest himself, just as we can only experience radio waves when there is a radio through which they are transformed into sound waves.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But we are in no doubt that radio waves exist even if we cannot hear them. The consciousness or mentality of the living being is also a reality that exists in ray- and waveform. It is these energies that cause the complete renewal of life and the transformation of the organism, both where it occurs in various stages as is the case with the above-mentioned insects, and where a gradual, almost imperceptible transformation takes place as in the case of the terrestrial human being. And if one compares the replacement of the organism of the above-mentioned insects and the replacement of the organism in that species of beings to which terrestrial human beings belong does one not have a proof that this ability to replace the organism is, like all other abilities, subject to evolution? The ability of the terrestrial human being to replace his organism is in reality far more developed than that of the insects.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To be able to replace one's organism quite imperceptibly as the terrestrial human being does in one physical incarnation through the stages of childhood, youth, maturity and old age without having to interrupt the functioning of the day-consciousness, and to be able to have the feeling that it is still the same organism, without this in reality being the case, is something of an ideal in relation to the stage of evolution where the beings in one incarnation have to go through a kind of death process several times.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The terrestrial human being has reached a step in evolution where he is free from that kind of unpleasant interruption in the transformation of the organism until his earthly life, through ill-health, accident or the natural wear and tear of old age, is interrupted and his consciousness is carried by the spiritual or ray-formed bodies, which also carry the consciousness during sleep. But when a more primitive way of replacing the organism than that of the human being exists, is it not just as natural that there also exists a way in relation to which that of the human being must be said to be primitive, but that the human being can gradually learn to use? This means a replacement of the organism where the process we call ''death'' can also be changed into a gradual process of transformation instead of an abrupt transition from one state to another. And thereby the "horror of death'' will be overcome and there will be no more state of shock associated with this process of transformation, which can be the case for people now when they see, with their physical eyes, the physical bodies of other people become corpses without being able, with the same eyes, to see the same people in the ray-formed bodies now carrying their consciousness.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Total and partial replacement of the organism</h2>
<div>When the transformation of the organism, the principle of rebirth or reincarnation, is thus subject to evolution, there must be a goal for this evolution, and this is to make the replacement more and more imperceptible. Terrestrial human beings and the categories of beings related to them have thus reached this goal to perfection within the individual terrestrial life. Indeed, they have reached such a degree of perfection that the human being does not at all notice the replacement of his organism, and denies reincarnation. They at the moment only notice the process of replacement where it is still not perfect and is called "death". Here they have not yet been able to create a partial replacement of the organism, and; because they are only used to a "partial death", they believe that the total replacement of the organism is tantamount to "total death". But it is only a short time that people will have such a belief based on lack of knowledge of the eternal laws of life. Many seeking people have already begun to succeed in finding a solution to the riddle of death.</div>
<div>But it is not the purpose of life that people should concern themselves with "death" and ''the spiritual world" on a mystical plane: it has to become crystal-clear science, and the human being with his knowledge and creative ability will in time be able to overcome death.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is the will of Providence or the Godhead that the living being, after a long period in the spiral of evolution, will reach a stage where he is able to experience his eternal existence without the interruptions in the organism that have to occur in the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom of the spiral of evolution. This means that such an imperceptible replacement of the organism as that which the terrestrial human being has come to master within a single terrestrial life, will one day in the future also be mastered by the same being when he glides from the physical state to the ray-formed state.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is really the concept "resurrection" that will in time be a reality for the terrestrial human being who, when he has reached such a step in evolution, where he is able to control matter with his will, can no longer be described as a "terrestrial human being" but as a "real human being", a "human being in God's image."</div>
<div></div>
<div>In my cosmic analyses and symbols I show where in the spiral of evolution this goal will become a reality. In the last part of the third kingdom of the spiral, the real human kingdom, such a perfect existence will begin to become a fact. Then the being's transition from the physical to the spiritual experience of life will no longer be hindered by any "death process''. The transition will be just as perfect as the transition from childhood to youth, from youth to maturity and from maturity to old age is today for the terrestrial human being.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Learning to die by learning to live</h2>
<div>Until this epoch of evolution has been reached the terrestrial human being must, however, still experience his existence as an appearance demarcated into physical and spiritual separate lives where the transition can only take place as the total replacement of the organisms. This in turn usually causes the being to be conscious in only one of the two spheres, that in which he at the moment finds himself, and often during his stay, at any rate in the physical world, he is apt to deny the existence of the other sphere. In principle it is in a way the same as if the caterpillars were to deny the existence of the butterfly. Through modern spiritual science the seeking "human caterpillars" of our time have, however, the possibility to get to know something other than their own little local "caterpillar-world". They can acquire an overview of the evolution of life, of the process of creation in the midst of which they are situated, and they can acquire knowledge about what promotes the development of that state in which pain, suffering and death are totally overcome.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This state of the imperceptible replacement of the organism that the terrestrial human being now experiences in a physical incarnation has taken him a very long time to reach, and it is just as much a matter of course that it must take some time before the transition to the spiritual world can take place in the same way. But even now the individual terrestrial human being has the possibility to turn death into something beautiful instead of something horrifying. He can learn to die by learning how to live, that is, by getting to know the laws of life and trying to live in accordance with them. The more the human being with his thoughts, feelings and actions lives on the same wavelength as the basic note of the universe or universal morality - to be a joy and a blessing for all living beings - the easier death will be when it one day comes. It will be felt like a renewal of life, a lovely rest from the, at times, rather difficult life in physical matter. But it will not be the kind of rest one can get in an armchair or on a sofa. No - it will be as if one experiences the most wonderful holiday one can imagine. With one's thoughts as the means of transport one can visit zones and spheres at will. This too is based on universal laws. Then a replacement of the organism again occurs. The being must go back to that world in which there is resistance (which causes evolution), that world in which it hurts to think wrongly. But now he gets a new, healthy organism, which is built up in his mother's womb, and new possibilities in a coming physical life to learn to think and to learn to live so that he can gradually overcome death.</div>

        <title><![CDATA[False Prophets and False Christs]]></title>
        <content><![CDATA[<div>Since many false prophets will gradually arise, some of whom will even try to pass themselves off as Jesus Christ, the question of how one can recognise them has arisen and gained current interest. I have therefore felt compelled to refer here to Christ's own statements about the event that has been called "the second coming of Christ". Christ himself warned very earnestly against these false prophets and false Christs, just as in a symbolic language he has constantly explained, for those who have ears to hear with and eyes to see with, how this so-called "second coming" will be. I will therefore refer to the gospels of Matthew, Mark and John in which he says: "Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." (Matt. 24:25, 26, 27 and 30)</div>
<div>Christ further warns by saying: "Take heed lest any man deceive you: For many shall come in my name saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or , lo, he is there; believe him not: For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect." (Mark 13: 5-6, 21-22)</div>
<div>"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whosoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you." (John 16:12-14)</div>
<div></div>
<div>We have here some reproduced from the Bible some of Christ's own statements about his so-called "second coming". What is the true reality now behind these divine promises given by the world redeemer about this "second coming"? When during his second coming he cannot be found in the desert or in the chambers, and cannot be found here or there, his second coming absolutely cannot be as a Christ in the form of an ordinary physical man. In such a case he would be easy to find and recognise. He warns of course against believing those who come and say that they are Christ, or say that he is to be found here or there. His second coming shall thus not be to any great extent physical in nature. His appearance will at any rate be anonymous. It is thus not his purely physical person itself that will be the primary factor in his second coming. The second coming is hidden.</div>
<div>What is it then that will reveal his second coming? Indeed, what does he himself say? Does he not say that it will be like lightening that comes from the east, and flashes to the west? What is it about his second coming that can have such force? This is but his world-redeeming, divine message to mankind all over the Earth, and thereby from the east to the west. And here he goes on to say, "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." (Matt. 24:30) What is this sign of the son of man that will appear in heaven? Here heaven means life's very highest sphere of consciousness or thought, that is the domain of universal love. Universal love is thus the sign of the son of man. When this sign appears the tribes of the Earth should mourn. Is this not precisely what we are seeing? Is the world not permanently in mourning? Have we not in this century experienced two great world wars? And are there not still wars and cold wars, murder and killing all over the world, concentration camps and torture chambers in which people are tortured to death in the most terrible ways? Can there be greater causes for the display of mourning and wretchedness? In this wretchedness the son of man will appear in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. The son of man means his divine message; it will thus emerge in the divine sphere of consciousness of universal love with power and much glory. What glory is it in the message of Christ that is to be revealed? This glory is an intellectualised renewal of his unintellectual message of about two thousand years ago. It is cosmic science, which reveals the following as fact: the existence of God; the immortality of living beings; the reincarnation or rebirth of beings; the existence of darkness as a vital necessity for the beings' experience of light and their future appearance as the human being in God's image after his likeness; the primary consciousness of God and the secondary consciousness of God; life's cosmic spirals; the microcosmos, mesocosmos and macrocosmos as living beings; universal love as the keynote of the universe; the beings' identity with the Godhead, time, space and eternity; that no one can do wrong and no one can suffer wrong; and that everything is very good. This is the main information contained in the "second coming" of Christ, which is the same as the continuation, renewal and perfection of Christianity. Can mankind be given a greater glory than the spirit of God in the form of consciousness, in thoughts and knowledge and way of being?</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Christ has more to say about his second coming, which means the perfection of his mission through the revelation of God's holy spirit as a science of the entire existence of the Godhead in a form intelligible to developed intelligence and feeling. What is the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in the name of Jesus or Christ, who will teach man all the things he has said to them? Is it not precisely thoughts and knowledge of the very highest realities in life about the existence of God and the existence of human beings and God's loving plan for all living beings? What else can constitute the holy spirit or God's consciousness?</div>
<div></div>
<div>The fact that people during Christ's physical incarnation on Earth were not so developed as to be able to understand his entire mission, and he had therefore to promise its completion at a later point in time, is confirmed by Christ when he said to his disciples that he has yet many things to say to them, but they could not bear to hear them. For this reason he had to reckon on completing his mission at a later point in time, when people were more developed intellectually. He then again mentions the holy spirit or the spirit of truth, which means the science of truth, that will come and lead mankind to the whole truth. It will tell mankind of things to come. It will glorify Christ, by taking from what is Christ's and making it known to mankind.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The mission of Christ this time will not be based on a physical Christ personality with authority and miracles. The person this time is anonymous. Only the Christ consciousness in the form of cosmic science will be the primary factor in the renewal and perfection that is promised or understood as the second coming of Christ. It is this holy spirit of truth or science of universal love that, as life's third testament, will become the foundation of life in the new world epoch beginning now.</div>
<div>I have explained here in brief Christ's own statements about his so-called "second coming" and his earnest warning to people that they should not believe all the many false prophets who will arise at the same time as his second coming, and who will not hesitate to claim to be Jesus Christ himself. It is good that many of these self-appointed prophets are so naive that they try to pass themselves off as Christ. In this way they reveal for the developed human being that they are not Christ.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope these lines can be of benefit to people who are in the dark about "the second coming of Christ".</div>

        <content><![CDATA[<div>
<div>1. Every living being that comes into the world, regardless of whether it belongs to the community of beings we call "terrestrial mankind" or whether it belongs to those forms of life which manifest themselves through what we are accustomed to recognize as "animals", "plants" and "minerals", is, without exception, subject to the experience of life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2. As the experience of life can only exist as an interaction between two forms of energy, namely, the energy radiating from the universe in the form of our surroundings, and the energy radiating from our own inner being in the form of our manifestation, and as this interaction in the form of the experience of life is really identical with the creation of our own existence, it must be clearly evident that we, each of us, constitute a by no means insignificant factor in this creation of our fate, and this especially so owing to the fact that in a certain area we do possess a so-called "free will".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3. This is the same as to say that every living being is facing an ocean of forces, the collective manifestation of which under the concept of "nature" - in the form of the elements, in the form of substance or matter, in the form of thought climates and especially in the form of fellow beings - is able to affect it through a scale of greatly differing forms of manifestation, ranging from the most dreadful forms of unpleasantness to the most wonderful and radiant forms of pleasantness. This gigantic organization of forces may, then, just as easily affect the individual fearfully and horribly as it may affect him pleasurably or happily, and is therefore, in equal degree, a contributory factor in the creation of a happy as well as an unhappy fate for the individual.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4. As I mentioned before, we are not entirely at the mercy of these tremendous forces, for in reality, within the area governed by our free will, we constitute the dominating factor in the regulation of the influence of these tremendous forces upon our own existence. But again, as normally the most important factor behind our free will is our own knowledge, it depends on the scope of this knowledge whether we will meet a happy or unhappy fate. For if this knowledge does not cover an awareness of those realities which are identical with the unavoidable and necessary basis for a full harmony between our manifestations and the world energies, which will promote happiness, then we shall, in the same degree as our awareness deviates from it, meet a less ideal fate or experience of life. Consequently, our knowledge will in reality constitute the dominating factor in the regulation of our interaction with the influences directed towards us by nature. As we come to understand how to avoid those forms of energy that are uncomfortable and displeasing, we shall come more and more under the influence of those forms of energy that are pleasing and comfortable.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5. A glance at the world will tell us that the manifestation of living beings, the so-called "struggle for existence", is really identical with nothing more nor less than a striving to overcome everything of an unpleasant nature. When we build houses or when we wear clothes, then it is only for overcoming those world energies which in the form of an adverse climate, might otherwise undermine our experience of life. The same shows itself in civilized societies where we find schools, hospitals, philanthropic institutions, police forces, fire brigades, government and administrative measures, churches, sects or religious communities, for these realities are, every one without exception, synonymous with visible expressions of this struggle by human beings against those realities among world energies which are of an unsuitable nature for building up a happy fate for the individual. This "struggle for existence", or this ever-increasing effort by the individual to overcome and control the unpleasant forms of energy in nature, is normally recognized under the concept of "progress".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6. So, not being in possession of identical knowledge, all living beings consequently come to differ from each other in their interaction with nature, and thus come to experience widely differing fates, or forms of existence. And it is precisely through the chain of differing fates, or forms of existence thus evolved, that we are able to state that living beings are progressing through darkness into light, just as it is the perfect knowledge of this same chain that reveals to us from whence we come, where we are going, who we are and how to live, in order to bring our own expression of energy into contact with the manifestation directed towards us by nature, and so make ourselves subject to complete happiness. As this happiness or perfect fate of the individual thus depends upon an absolutely true knowledge of the profoundest laws and eternal basic principles of life and hence the knowledge of the very purpose of life, then from a cosmic point of view - because terrestrial mankind is still unaware - the acquisition of such knowledge will be synonymous with "the one thing needful".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>7. As my own life is of such a nature that I have been enabled to experience for myself the above-mentioned knowledge in such a purity that in all ways it justifies the divine words: "Everything is very good"*, and consequently can only exist as synonymous with the exact and direct answer to the world's ever-present question: "What is Truth?", then I have felt that it is my duty to make this experience, or knowledge of mine, accessible to the general public; and it is precisely my first-hand knowledge about cosmic realities - in the form of a super-terrestrial Providence or Divine Being ruling the universe - which I am endeavouring to demonstrate by the expressions: "Livets Bog" and "Eternal Wisdom".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>8. As such a demonstration must necessarily contain subjects or thought formations with which ordinary terrestrial mankind has not yet ever, or only occasionally, occupied himself, and consequently cannot have any mental training at all in maintaining or utilizing in his consciousness, I have thought it useful to give these thought realities materially visible expression, so that instead of merely constituting mental manifestations from which only practised thinkers or occultists would be able to benefit, they now appear as tangible, material pictorial forms which, accessible to physical sight, can be as readily and easily investigated as a distant geographical territory with its rivers, mountains and cities can be studied on a well-executed map of the said territory. So, the object of my illustrations is to make the study of the cosmic or spiritual universe as readily accessible to the general public as the study of physical, material territories is nowadays to a child at school by means of geography. For it is not, in fact, the purpose of life, or the plan of the divine world order, that the study of these most profound realities should continue to be available to only a few select people; particularly so, because there exists no better foundation or releasing factor for creating that "everlasting peace" so urgently desired by all humanity, than just the result of all peoples' access to the said study and to knowledge of the analysis of the cosmic universe.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>9. In order to understand properly my form of illustration, it must be borne in mind, that the mental or cosmic realities expressed by my pictures have no material or physical form but are identical with cosmic universal laws, fundamental principles, ideas, causes and methods of sensing. But realities which have no material pictorial form cannot, of course, be reproduced, copied or photographed. Consequently, my illustrations are in no way identical with photographs or artistic reproductions of what they represent, as might very well be the case, for instance, with a geographical map. On the contrary, my illustrations come into being in the following way; when I wish to illustrate one or another of the above-named formless realities, I give to each of the more important, local details occurring in the said reality, a particular mark or sign, either in colour, line or shape. These varying signs are then combined or arranged in a certain order or succession which corresponds to the combination - invisible to the physical senses - in which they exist in reality. In this way, a material picture appears which in its nature is not a copy of, but a visible mark or clue to a reality invisible within the material field. The practical result of this is that the cosmic realities in this manner attain a certain accessibility to material sight, so that some of the human beings who have not yet developed a sensory endowment over and above that mentioned sight, will thus be enabled to begin to work with them at an earlier stage than might otherwise have been the case, and by that obtain knowledge of the experience of life which would otherwise have remained hidden. My illustrations do not, then, reproduce pictorially what they are intended to express, but on the contrary symbolize it, and hence can rightfully only be regarded as symbols.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>10. In connection with the information given above, I have felt in addition that it might be of advantage to give in advance a general view of the tolerant and unconstrained form in which Livets Bog makes its entry into this Globe's sphere of thought, hoping, in this way, to encourage the expression of an attitude most suitable and useful for the student with regard to the book in question. It is therefore my intention to make my reader understand that the universal world picture, or eternal wisdom which through a divine fatherly communication in the form of the direct speech of life has been infused into my consciousness, and the further transformation of which, in the form of Livets Bog, it has become my privilege to manifest to the world by virtue of the knowledge identical with the said manifestation, does not in any way claim, or suggest any right, to constitute a so-called "one and only salvation", for such claims or demands cannot possibly be put forward or indeed exist as anything but signs or symptoms of ignorance. For the Father, Providence or the Almighty assuredly never allows any single manifestation, no matter by whom or by what this manifestation may be expressed, to become powerful enough to render superfluous all other forms of manifestation, but on the contrary, makes equal use of all existing manifestations together in order to produce the blessedness that is best suited to the hopes and longings of every single person, and in this way makes every living being present itself as an absolutely indispensable performer in the gigantic adventure which is called "life". The manifestations of any single living being, be they never so brilliant or perfect, will then, in themselves, never be powerful enough to render superfluous all the other forms of influence exerted by Providence or the Almighty upon other living beings. Consequently, we have never seen and will never come to see that a so-called "holy man", or a so-called "holy writ" will be able to constitute more than a single fragment of the stupendous interaction of forces which every day reveal themselves to us as a living, illustrated picture-gallery in which universes, suns, planets and creatures, each with its own form of beauty or inspirational value, and all in accordance with our stage of development and our sensory power, sail before our wondering eyes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>11. Livets Bog is identical with a result produced by the material effects of the super-physical state of the entire universe emanating from such a large field, and being of such an extensive nature that a pure, unprejudiced, personally experienced general view of it can only be obtained through a set of sensory faculties which observe from a stage of evolution, or viewpoint, that can be reached only by the help of a fully developed faculty of love. Therefore the complete understanding and realization of the true nature of the book will be more and more partially coloured or transformed by the reader's own set of sensory equipment, to the same degree as he belongs to a stage of development where one still only possesses a less evolved or biased faculty of love.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>12. A person possessing a biased faculty of love should be taken to mean here, someone whose personal experience material is not yet of such a character that he is able, innately, to see or sense that no manifestation whatsoever can exist without being at the same time a result of a lower and a basis for a higher state of manifestation. Then neither can he himself exist without being identical with an indispensable factor in the process called "evolution", nor without being at the same time a confirmation that: "Everything is very good". As an individual's experience material - as long as it does not contain those experiences which prove to the person in question that everything is very good - appears as a regulator of the same individual's faculty of love, the latter will respectively come to germinate and flourish only in those fields where the person's experience material is germinating and flourishing. But this, then, is the same as to say that the individual in such a case possesses a greater love and thus a greater capacity for feeling tolerance in those fields where his experience material is flourishing, than in the fields where it is only germinating, and he will accordingly be able to manifest himself in life only in a biased manner, or be more sympathetically inclined towards certain fields of experience than towards others.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>13. As existence in itself in all its details or manifestations is synonymous with the only existing final and absolute Truth, (everything, or every type of manifestation in existence being useful to exactly the same degree and therefore correspondingly indispensable to the existing state of development or organization of individuals), then the fact of being more sympathetically inclined, or more appreciative towards one thing than towards another, amounts to being only partly in contact with the full manifestation of the real Truth. But this unbalanced attitude of the individual towards the real Truth is indeed very natural, for it can only be manifested by an individual who, as said above, by reason of having insufficient experience material, is unable to realize that everything is indeed very good, and whotherefore cannot but feel a certain degree of antipathy towards that in life which is more or less inharmonious with what he himself thinks is right. He consequently does not yet possess the experience material that forms the basis for an individual's transformation into an instrument for releasing towards all living beings a culminating sympathy or love entirely unbiased, independent and uninfluenced by their manifestations or their stage in development.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>14. As Livets Bog is given to a world especially reserved for human beings manifesting biased love or sympathy, I cannot, of course, quite prevent there being many - even among the most outstanding people - who will not be able to understand Livets Bog immediately, because it is equivalent to a version - regulated by a culminating faculty of love - of the existing, true, majestic world picture in all its balanced manifestation of universal unity. Although the book is presented in an elementary form adapted to the said people, this will probably not, after all, manage to preclude them - on account of their innate predispositions - from being compelled, more or less, in their study of the contents of the said book to overrate or underrate its related details, according to how much they are still biased in their consciousness. Therefore, they will only be able to give themselves an understanding, or mental image of those details which will be more or less biased in favour of those areas in which their faculties of love are most developed, and more or less to the disadvantage of areas in which this same faculty is least developed. Against this background all human beings will, through their natural ability, be forced in the latter areas to feel a form of intolerance which will become all the greater the less their faculty of love is developed in the same areas, for this intolerance will always appear to them in the guise of "justice", according to how much - in greater or lesser degree - they lack the ability in such areas to see that everything is, indeed, very good. Now, as this intolerance masked as justice exists, therefore, as a natural predisposition in the said human beings, they will not have any other means of mastering it than a possible outward or theoretical basis. By their concept of the absolute Truth - in other words of existing reality, with its laws, principles and ideas - they will differ from the picture given of it in Livets Bog to the same degree as their concept of it deviates from being unbiased or balanced. As this concept is, however, not created by their will, but by their personally acquired experience material up to the present - and this, as stated above, is of such a character that it has not yet been able to create a basis for a culminating faculty of love, and thus cannot possess a tolerance directed towards all areas - such individuals will be forced - possibly in several areas - to become even my opponents, however much they might wish otherwise. But as the result of such a divergent concept will always lead finally to an acknowledgement of reality, all who, on account of their natural predispositions, have been forced to become my opponents will, in actual fact, be my co-workers, and in this case, as in all other decrees of life, there will be no possible reason for retaliation, or reacting to the intolerance of such people with a reply generated by intolerance, but on the contrary, it can be quite a firm basis for a reply brought forth by love in the form of a guiding and helping hand. And the exposure of actual reality, or the Truth in the form of Livets Bog, will neither, therefore, in any single instance, prove a weaker defence for - or vindication of - its opponents than it constitutes in the case of all other living beings or individuals in existence.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>15. Although in this Preface I have touched problems which will be given their special elucidation later on in the book, it is done, as I mentioned before, solely to inform the reader of the infinite understanding, tolerance and freedom that will be granted his concept of - and by that his attitude to - Livets Bog by that Source from which the said book came. This is regardless of whatever that attitude might be, so that his own thoughts, opinions and views by no means, either now or in the future, should ever be bound dogmatically by this same book. On the contrary, by it he will be granted all possible inspiration in full freedom to think for himself, to work for himself and furthermore, of his own free will to collect his own information from any kind of book or from any kind of place where for him these especially suitable - and thus inspiring - realities may be found. From the Source of Livets Bog it has long ago been realized that it is quite useless for a person to seek information in the said book if the information most appropriate to inspire him is to be found only in Islam, Buddhism or Christianity for instance, including their respective sects and textbooks, just as it is equally useless for a person to search in any of the places mentioned if the information that is of especial inspirational value to the said person can be found only in Livets Bog. The purpose of Livets Bog is therefore not to entice the reader away from any religion, sect, belief or concept of life to which he might adhere, and which may be of an especially animating value, or a divine inspiration to him. On the contrary, on the basis of its universal impartiality of the highest degree, it aims only to guide the seeker of Truth to the understanding of the daily events of life with its incidents, its happy and unhappy experiences, its light and dark scenes, as being identical with a communication released by Providence and especially adapted to him personally. The individual in question, as he gradually becomes conscious in his own eternal existence, will be able to reflect on this communication just as easily as he is now able to reflect on a communication with his fellows. Thus, to the researcher, Livets Bog will give an insight into how this previously mentioned communication or the direct speech of life, exists as life's absolutely sole fundamental religion, only able to exist with literally everybody as teachers, with everybody as pupils and with all things as doctrines. As all human beings thereby exist as inborn members of this religion, it has no preceding ceremonies of entry or initiation. And as its scope from eternity to eternity comprises nothing less than the entire universe itself, we have here the only existing religion, in which there is to be found literally but one flock and one shepherd.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As Livets Bog constitutes a reproduction of the experience of this all-embracing "religion of life" and has been manifested with the purpose of stimulating the development of the individual's ability to understand the said religion for himself, he will thus become able - not from Livets Bog - but from life's own direct speech, to see for himself what may and what may not be done, what is real and what is unreal, so it will be understandable that Livets Bog is not intended in any way at all to work as a stimulating force for the establishment of any sect, religion or creed. This is especially so because the "religion of life", as mentioned above, recognizes all living beings, those having faith and those who have not, both the so-called "holy" and the so-called "ungodly", as well as all animals and all people as its born members, practitioners and devotees. And for this same reason Livets Bog will neither come to present itself as a combination of specific prohibitions, religious laws or penalty clauses. On the contrary it will present itself as a purely voluntary guidance released by love to help the seeker of Truth studying in the school of life to find his way to whatever or whomever in his daily surroundings and experiences he might find to be an especially fashioned, life-giving inspiration or instructive purpose in the formation of a future happy fate for himself, completely without regard to whatever zone, condition or concept of life that "what" or "who" might represent. Livets Bog cannot, therefore, be encapsulated in, or monopolized by, any kind of sect or community; for, just because of its universal, impartial manifestation of love and wisdom, it can never come to exist without forming a textbook equally for those who are not members of any sect as it is for those who are, just by virtue of its identity as a universal expression of life's own living religion - of which everyone, as said above, is a member, and all things are doctrines.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>16. To every seeker of Truth, or student of the highest problems in life, it will be extremely important to be guided to the right informative Source. As divine wisdom radiates through so many widely differing forms of human beings, sciences, religions and arts, the seeker of Truth can have difficulties in finding out which of these mentioned realities and which form of the same reality will constitute the right informative Source especially adapted for him. It may, therefore, be helpful to state here that, for a reality or manifestation to be identical with the right Source for an individual, it must be of such a nature that it exactly harmonizes with the level of consciousness or zone of experience to which the individual in question belongs, and which, consequently, will affect this same individual as a life-giving inspiration. If the reality in question lies too far ahead of the said individual's field of experience or level of consciousness, it will seem too far-fetched to the same individual in just the same way as it would be naïve if it were too far below his level of development, and then, in both cases, it would not touch those chords in the individual's consciousness which would enable him to experience the said reality as truth. But when something cannot be experienced as truth, the same thing will have a touch of untruth. And here we are facing the basic principle of the problems which are usually known under the concept of "false prophets", "false Messiahs", "false world teachers" and so on. As we see here, these persons need not be absolutely false but will only become false where their life-giving or informative value is so far in advance of, or so far behind such an individual's level of character or stage of development, that no contact or reasonable connection between them can be initiated.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Therefore, for every individual or every seeker of Truth, in daily behaviour and experience of life it is a matter of finding those people, those forms of manifestation, that kind of reading, that occupation or that little or that much, which must be for him the same as an absolutely life-giving or stimulating basis for his development from ignorance to knowledge, from darkness to light, from the dismal kingdoms of sorrow and shadows to the radiant zones around the eternal Godhead.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>17. In order to help the seeker of Truth to recognize if he has found the right source which is especially valid for him, it will be helpful to mention that such people, things or manifestations that are of especial inspirational value to an individual, or such realities which can operate as identical with the above-mentioned stimulating basis, can very easily be recognized by the fact that they - by being experienced and sensed - send through the individual in question a flow of warm waves, a flow of life-force and energy, of ideas, of longing to represent a higher degree of perfection, a flow of hope and faith in Providence and the Father, of divine satisfaction, harmony and happiness and an irresistible urge for loving; in other words, an increased ability to love everything and everybody. Where he is in contact with one or more of these flows, there is his right place in life. And without question, solely there can the individual have hope of acquiring the first feeble tendencies towards the ability to experience consciously his own daily existence as a divine fatherly communication, or talk reserved and adjusted by Providence especially for him, precisely the one and only existing form for tuning in his consciousness or attitude to that experience of life through which it is possible for the individual to become one with the Way, the Truth and the Life, and thereby one with the Father or to become conscious in the Godhead. Whether the individual has his contact with the above-mentioned flows via this or that religion, via Livets Bog or any other book, or via one or other of the many other realities in life, is thus of very minor importance. The main point is, however, that the individual is just there, where he either has, or can obtain, contact with that through which his own inspiration can be released.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>18. Having said this, I hope that the reader will be able to realize that in Livets Bog one will not find any kind of intolerance, but on the contrary, will be met with the very greatest understanding and sympathy by this very book, completely irrespective of what level of consciousness or state of character one may happen to have, and consequently completely irrespective of whatever attitude towards Livets Bog one might adopt.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In connection with this, I trust I have guided Livets Bog away from all those factors which, through a mistaken interpretation of the true nature of the book, would otherwise have made it dogmatically binding or repressive for independent thought and manifestation both now and in the future.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>19. Having explained the tolerance and sympathy that will be shown to every reader's or investigator's attitude towards Livets Bog from the Source whence this book has emanated, all that is left for me now is to give a short survey of my own relationship to it and to the core of the matter in its content, which is herewith expressed in the following lines:</div>
<div></div>
<div>For terrestrial mankind's present dawning level of cosmic consciousness, Livets Bog constitutes an apt and complete description of the universe, life or existence, transformed down from that zone in evolution where all super-physical or spiritual realities do not exist as mysticism or utopias, but on the contrary, manifest themselves in fullest measure as constituting the fundamental, conscious experiences and details of daily life in the way that I, through my own cosmic set of sensory organs - developed and regulated by love, intelligence and intuition - have been able to experience it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the above manner life has shown itself to me as a state of radiant light and perfection as well as revealing living beings' identity as "Sons of God". It has further shown me that love is the most powerful factor in all manifestation, in that to be a joy and blessing for everything with which one comes into contact is the only way for the individual to throw light on himself, on his divine Father and on the existing world order. At the same time it is the only thing that can liberate or lead him away from everything known under the concept of "pain", and finally that every individual's fate is built up from the effects of which he himself is the cause. And so I have felt that by revealing my condition of consciousness in the form of pictures, text, speech and my way of life, I can be of use as a helping hand to all those who are in search of the Truth, the Father or the Godhead, and be of use to everything with which the Father has surrounded me. The fundamental usefulness in this may, amongst other things, be emphasized thus - that Livets Bog, on account of the universal outlook it represents, exists as constituting in itself the one and only great defence for the reader in the face of all those who might happen to appear as his critics. The reader's main purpose, then, is to inspire his critics to learn to love him in such a way that they will be kind and considerate towards him, and at the same time he must show them that every time they forgive him, however more or less serious the annoyance he may have caused them, they free themselves from one of the sandbags, the weight of which in the form of "non-forgiveness" keeps them tied to the lower and less developed planes of existence, and from where, to the same degree as these sandbags have been released, they can, more and more freely and unhindered, lift themselves up to lighter and happier planes and regions of existence before the eternal throne. This will show them that the outcome is not a beautiful dream but a true reality in daily existence all around them; it will teach the reader's critics to understand that he, just like themselves and all other existing beings, works in the same garden, and that, as I have already pointed out, there is only one God and one religion, the living illustrating doctrines of which every single moment are being demonstrated to every individual son of God by a fatherly communication, via the surroundings adapted to his temporary level of evolution. It will make it clear as well that this one God and this one religion comprises and constitutes all that exists and that all else in life under the concepts of "religions" are but echoes or clusters of rays from this one all-embracing living religion's immense ocean of light.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As the Father has thus permitted my personal experience, state of consciousness and the course of events in my life, to be of such a nature that its transcription in the form of Livets Bog has become identical with a disclosure of all living beings' identity as "sons of God", simultaneously uncovering the close mutual relationship between all religions like clusters of rays from one and the same sea of light and thereby constituting a further defence of all living beings, He has thereby in a wonderful way made Livets Bog a tool for the demonstration and the removal of the last remnant of that form of ignorance which leads to intolerance and its companion, "suffering". For ignorance is in fact the true cause of everything known to the world as "evil". Where ignorance has been removed the so-called "evil" ceases to exist.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Everything which falls under the term "evil" is thus identical with the effects of ignorance, and consequently such effects cannot exist without at the same time representing the motivating factor behind all forms of the question - "Why?" or the cry - "More knowledge!" which from the thousandfold legions of human beings is directed towards the Eternal Light. And so the Father, precisely by making Livets Bog the above-mentioned tool, has made it a reflection of His own inexhaustible principle of wisdom casting it back in response to the said cry. He has thus allowed the "Eternal Truth" to appear in a new incarnation so that it can continue to shine upon and give out warmth over the world in everlasting youthful beauty, power and radiance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>20. As for information about myself, I have only this to say - that since I have been enabled to experience life in the way referred to in this Preface, it is entirely due to the facts which will be elucidated in detail later in Livets Bog under the term the "Great Birth". Therefore here in the Preface only the following explanation is necessary - that the birth referred to is synonymous with the release of a super-physical or spiritual process which will occur in any individual's consciousness when this has been brought forward to the manifestation of an evolutionary stage especially adapted for love, intelligence and intuition. This will consequently cause the release of the latent super-physical or spiritual faculties dwelling in the said individual, and in this way impart to him a corresponding spiritual or cosmic sense horizon in which he experiences fundamentally his own immortality, the purpose of life and the eternal Godhead. As regards my present incarnation, I experienced this spiritual process in all its fundamental magnitude when I was thirty years old. After having repeatedly passed through its powerful white and golden baptism of fire, I discovered that I had acquired entirely new faculties. I began, as it were, to be able to look straight into eternity itself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>21. I realized that I was an immortal being and that all other living beings in existence were eternal realities which, like myself, had an endless chain of previously lived lives behind them, that all of us have evolved from low, primitive forms of existence to our present stage, that this is only a temporary link on this evolutionary scale, and that we are thus on our way forward towards gigantic, higher planes of existence away in the far distance. I saw that the universe constitutes one single enormous living being in which all other beings are - one and all - organs, and that we - all people, animals, plants and minerals - form one family, and that we, figuratively speaking, are of the same flesh and blood. I saw brilliant and scintillating worlds with unimaginable humanities, humanities possessing morals and idealism which, divinely unfolding and in harmony with the law of existence, and in relation to generally accepted earthly morals, was like comparing an oasis to the desert. But I also saw worlds which were of a much lower nature, worlds in which barbarism constituted such a determining power that the living beings there had to kill in order to live; in fact, worlds where the ruling conditions of life were synonymous with the most enormous violation of the law of existence, thus turning these worlds into the most conspicuous setting for a display of illness and distress, misery, sorrow and suffering, which in actual fact indicates globes in a category from which this terrestrial Globe cannot quite be exempt. Furthermore, I saw that the darkness or the so-called "evil" in reality was identical with the individuals' development of those qualifications which are absolutely necessary if life in the later higher worlds is to be experienced by them as happiness or bliss, and by that I came to realize that "darkness" is just as great a blessing for cosmic understanding as is "light", and that everything in the divine sight is "very good". But I felt too that this knowledge could never be experienced, or could never stand forth as a true reality for any human being until his faculty of love is so far developed in its evolution that he is only able to be good or loving towards all living beings, and thus could never misuse that said knowledge in making it a defence for egoistic or unloving actions. Thus I have felt the entire universe pervaded by an endless love and wisdom. Wherever I directed my sight in the "darkness", there it became light - I had become my own source of light. The cosmic baptism of fire through which I had passed - the closer analysis of which I cannot specify here - had thus released in me entirely new sensory abilities, abilities which enabled me - not in glimpses - but on the contrary in a permanent state of awake day-consciousness - to apprehend all main spiritual forces, invisible causes, eternal world laws, basic energies and basic principles behind the physical world. The mystery of existence was therefore no longer a mystery to me. I had become conscious in the life of the whole universe, and had been initiated into the "Divine Creative Principle".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>22. One point also worthy of note is that after the experience described above I was completely unable to read. The mere thought of reading a book was enough to produce a feeling in my brain as if it were going to burst. And during the period from the time when I went through that spiritual process, until I had looked through the entire world picture fundamentally and manifested it in picture form, I was not in touch with any kind of book or any other kind of theoretical guidance. Also, before the awakening of my cosmic faculties I must be considered as having been quite an unread person, never having really studied but only having received ordinary primary schooling, which, as I was born in the countryside, meant just three hours twice a week in the summer and only a little more in the winter. In that school I was brought up in Christianity or in what I call in my own message the "old spiritual world impulse". So, with the exception of my childhood learning, I had not been in connection with either theosophy, anthroposophy, spiritualism or any other particular school of thought of the time until after I had experienced the entire world picture and then manifested it in the form of my symbols and drawings. Thanks to these fortunate circumstances my entire cosmic manifestation will now belong to the world in its complete original purity, and this indicates that my existence constitutes a living proof of the fact that there is indeed a stage in eternal evolution when it is possible - quite independently of books or of other people's learnt theoretical knowledge, but by absolute self-realization - to arrive at the highest knowledge and wisdom and, in the middle of an earthly physical state, to achieve elevation to an eternal transfigured existence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This my cosmic experience and condition became the releasing factor for my subsequent activities in the world and for the creation of Livets Bog. But as this spiritual process, as mentioned before, will be experienced by every human being when, in its eternal existence, it is passing through that stage of development which is necessary for the said experience, then it will be seen here that, concerning sensory gifts, I do not represent any special privilege or any exception to the rule, and thus in eternal evolution I could not possibly constitute one single jot more than that which all other living beings before me have been, and which all other living beings after me will be.</div>

<div></div>]]></intro>
        <content><![CDATA[<div> </div>
<h2>1. The world’s greatest religious commandment</h2>
<div>Why should one study the cosmic analyses of the universe, which for some beings may be difficult to understand? Human beings have through their religions and world redeemers been shown the way to God! Is there really anyone who can see a better and more perfect way to God or the creation of a true culture than what has already been given, for example in Jesus’ “Sermon on the Mount” and the other holy commandments given by Christ? Can one receive better instruction on the way to the light than this: “Love your God above all things and your neighbour as yourself”? The answer must be that it would be quite impossible to point to any way towards God, the light, or an absolutely perfect culture that does not first and foremost have precisely this unshakeable divine commandment as a guide and as the true foundation of life. The cosmic analyses and the symbols of the structure of life have definitely not been manifested in order to lead human beings away from the holy commands of Christ, or away from any of the other great world religions and their more or less holy commands or guidelines for morality and ways of living. Quite the opposite, they have been manifested precisely in order to show that the core within the greatest cosmic con- clusions or dogmas revealed by these beings is the absolute truth.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>2. The world situation or the forthcoming “Doomsday”</h2>
<div>The fact that it is necessary to point this out is made clear by the world situation today. It is such that one is forced to express it as the condition of Armageddon, which, according to Christ, would befall human beings in the “last days”. Furthermore, is it not said in the biblical account of the future that “the devil shall rage in all his power”? What have we seen in the form of the two World Wars, which have raged among terrestrial mankind this century? Have we not seen attempts to wipe out great cities with their inhabitants and cultural values? Have not people even tried to annihilate an entire human race? Have we not seen millions of human beings murdered – not only on the battlefields while defending their country or attacking other peoples’ living space, but also in civilian life by being sent to gas chambers where they were murdered outright without any judicial or lawful basis, and naturally without any regard whatsoever for the vitally important commandments, “Thou shalt not kill”, “Thou shalt forgive thy neighbour”, “Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword”? Is not the fulfilment of all the law precisely the great commandment, “Thou shalt love thy God above all things and thy neighbour as thyself”? Where is the belief in a loving God and a practical Christian culture in this Doomsday existence, where crowds of human beings, children and adults, old and young, have languished unto death in the terrible concentration or death camps, which have thrown shadows of devil consciousness over the whole Earth?</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>3. Human beings are growing away from religious dogmas</h2>
<div>Why have the religious ideals, which have been proclaimed to human beings for thousands of years been unable to prevent these demonic manifestations and the consequent deaths, disability, illness, distress and lack of morality? Is it not apparent that the traditional religious ideals or dogmas, however divine they have been, have not been able to free humanity from this Doomsday epoch of terror? Do we not see that human beings are actually growing out of these ideals, almost like children growing out of clothes and shoes? That they therefore lose the ability to believe in them is perfectly natural. Have not millions of human beings become materialists and atheists? Is it not an equally incontrovertible fact that their numbers are still growing and that there are more and more empty seats in the churches or places of worship during the services? Does this not reveal it to be a fact that the very highest cosmic truths upon which life depends and the religious commandments or dogmas have become a mystery, have become something that one even thinks intelligent human beings cannot lower themselves to be involved with or believe in? Is it the human beings that there is something the matter with, or is it the religious ideals that are wrong?</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>4. Human beings who do not require logical justification for accepting the traditional religious ideals or dogmas</h2>
<div>In the absolute sense, it is neither the human beings nor the religious ideals that are wrong. The religious ideals are perfectly adapted to the evolutionary step of the human beings to whom they have been given. And to these beings they form the central foundation of their lives. But a large part of mankind has outgrown these evolutionary steps and to a greater or lesser extent has grown onto higher steps in evolution. They inhabit quite a different mental sphere to the one that the traditional religious conclusions or dogmas were adapted to, and which the beings concerned could one hundred percent surrender themselves to by virtue of their instinct, which was still to some extent flourishing. They were not yet so evolved as regards their intelligence that they required intellectual confirmation of or justification for these religious ideals or dogmas. To them it was enough that they were given by authorities.</div>
<h2> <br />5. Those human beings for whom the symbols and the main work, to which they are a supplement, are manifested</h2>
<div>But today things are different. In these times great masses of human beings have lost their ability to believe, because their instinct has more or less degenerated on account of the development of their intelligence. They have thereby gained the ability to analyse, carry out research and observe. As this development increases, it causes them to require, to a corresponding degree, logical justification or scientific substantiation for every thought construction or idea that they are to accept as truth. It would be quite unreasonable to blame these beings for their condition, as to them it is impossible to believe in the dogmas of the religious ideals, precisely because they are manifested as mere conclusions or postulates without the logical or scientific support of which they constitute the conclusions. It is for this reason that the present symbol book and the main work, to which the symbols are a supplement, has been produced. This book is therefore created in order to help those human beings who cannot possibly believe in bare assertions or postulates without any intellectual or logical substantiation, but who are, nevertheless, seeking, with heart and mind, the justification for the state of Doomsday, which they are beginning to sense must exist behind the primitiveness and folly of daily life. To these human beings’ cosmic studies there is here opened a road towards life’s own all-encompassing justification of the darkness in the world enabling it to be seen as a link in the creating of the eternal maintenance of the key-note of the universe: Love. Quoted from Martinus’ introduction to “The Eternal World Picture, Vol 1”.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>The fulfilment of Christ’s prophecies</h2>
<div>“The manifestation of world redemption in our time is to give people knowledge, not belief. But giving people knowledge is of course giving them spirit. And if this knowledge constitutes the solution to the mystery of life itself, and is a perfect analysis of the universe, the Godhead and the living being that together form a unit, it cannot avoid constituting or being one hundred percent identical to “the holy spirit”. And this alone can be the fulfilment of what the Bible, through Christ, promised people.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>“My work is not a new form of dogma or a new object of belief, but is exclusively a science. True enough, it does not have its professors and doctors, but that does not alter the fact that it can never ever be invalidated, since it contains the absolute basis for the exact correspondence of everything</div>
<div>with the great conclusion, “everything is very good”, the dark as well as the light, the evil as well as the good. A better analysis and thereby a better foundation for life cannot be created and cannot exist. A greater basis for neighbourly love cannot thus be given, and a greater basis for the creation of the being’s own liberation could thus never be revealed either, since such a basis would be totally impossible. But since my work is an analysis of the truth, a scientific explanation of how it can be that everything is very good, and is thus the analysis of life itself, it is not anything that I can be the originator of. It has no originator; it is the analysis of life itself and exists from eternity to eternity. It is not an analysis of the nature of the Godhead that is merely true of a little locality in the universe or for a single, short period of time. It is an analysis that can never be out of date and shows that the conclusion that “everything is very good” can be nothing but the very greatest truth. And as such it cannot be anything other than “spiritual science” or the holy spirit. The holy spirit, which thus constitutes the very highest science, cannot possibly belong to a certain nation, it cannot possibly be Danish or German, it cannot be American or English, just as it cannot be theosophical, anthroposophical, spiritualistic or Martinian. It is to the very highest degree international, indeed, interplanetary or in every imaginable way non-individual. It is the life in which we all life and move and have our being. It is the omnipresent “Spirit of God that moves upon the face of the waters”. Quoted from “Spiritual science” – English Kosmos No. 3 – 2000.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Martinus’ ability to experience cosmically</h2>
<div>“As I have already related, my spiritual mission began with several psychic experiences, the particular structure of which was something entirely private to myself alone. What proved to be of significance to other people was the fact that they left me in a state in which I was able to receive far-reaching knowledge about the whole universe, in fact even the divine world plan was completely laid out before my sensing faculty and became awake day consciousness. I was granted the faculty to sense things that it was impossible to experience through mere physical sensing. I saw how every limited thing, irrespective of whatever size it might occupy, revealed infinity and thereby eternity. Eternity thus became visible as the fixed point, while time and thereby space were whatever was moving. As I was thus conscious in eternity, I became identical with what was “absolute” and “everlasting” and I saw all things from this “absoluteness” and “everlastingness”. As I had become conscious in eternity and was identical with immortality, I lived beyond any concept of time. I lived both before and after anything whatsoever and could thus see both its alpha and its omega, its beginning and its conclusion, that is, the whole of its life course. And it is this experiencing faculty that in my main work, “Livets Bog” (The Book of Life), I have called “cosmic consciousness”, just as I have called the descriptions of the details of life seen from this observation faculty, “cosmic analyses”. These “cosmic analyses” of mine are thus the same as observations made possible as a result of my liberation from time and space. My psychic experiences were a process that in a manner of speaking suddenly brought about this liberation in my consciousness. I had experienced an “initiation”. It was through this process that a change took place in my consciousness. Whereas before I had only been conscious in a certain time and a certain space, I had now become in a certain way conscious in all times and in all spaces. Whereas my consciousness before this experience of mine was an expression of “local consciousness”, it had now become an expression of “universal consciousness”. And after this change in consciousness I had no problem in finding my bearings with respect to the fate of the living being and thereby the fate of terrestrial mankind. It was no problem for me to see that the whole ocean of sufferings that terrestrial human beings are in the midst of is exclusively due to the fact that they are still not mentally liberated. They are still bound by time, by space and by matter. Their view of life and the world has therefore nothing to do with actual eternal life or the real world plan. At the very most it constitutes merely the view of a local area of the universe. But to know or sense only a local area and to believe it to be the whole, is the same as to live under an illusion. And to live under illusions is in turn to live in error. And because a life based on errors can give rise only to disappointments we have arrived at the very cause of terrestrial mankind’s daily existence being a life of disappointment, sorrow and suffering.” Quoted from the first chapter of the article, “Mental Sovereignty” – English Kosmos No. 1 – 2003.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>No association, sect or body of believers</h2>
<div>“As my work, that is to say, the first volume of “Livets Bog” (The Book of Life), my lectures and the study groups throughout the country that are based on them, has begun the awaken an interest and create a movement, it is, in this respect, absolutely necessary that this movement is not led astray into limiting, encasing or crystallising itself in an association, sect or body of believers, thereby having a narrow-minded monopoly on “the one and only road to salvation”. This was written in 1933 and is a quotation from an article entitled “To the readers” in the first issue of Kosmos – the official magazine of the Martinus Institute of Spiritual Science.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>On the ability to speak directly with God</h2>
<div>“The mission of my work is to point human beings towards God’s own “speech”, a “speech” that is manifested in the form of everyday experiences. These human beings will thereby be free spiritual researchers and not “representatives” or “subjects” of an artificial spiritual organisation. Terrestrial mankind has now reached the stage in its evolution where it has to learn that divine wisdom pours forth in abundance all around. God talks to human beings through all things, both pleasant and unpleasant, through crises, poverty and unemployment, through war, revolution and suffering just as much as through good health, strength and well-being, through love, tolerance and wisdom. Everything is a radiant expression of the same being. Everything is a speech, a speech that resonates over the whole world, throughout the whole universe, throughout microcosmos and macrocosmos. It vibrates in the twinkling of the stars. It shines in the orbiting of the planets. It is heard whispering in the gentle breezes and murmuring in the depth of the forest. It whistles in the factory sirens and is felt in the roaring of the machines. It is sung over the cradle and is spoken at the graveside. It is the ability to sense only vaguely, as well as being certainty and belief. It is knowledge, recognition and hope. It is death, resurrection and life. It is colour, vibration and light. It is absolutely everything that can be sensed, thought and experienced. And because this speech, the more it is understood by the individual, proves to be a confirmation of the words “everything is very good”, it is therefore identical to the very highest manifestation of love and proclamation of wisdom.” Quoted from Kosmos 1933.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>What is “the holy spirit”?</h2>
<div>“What then does mankind demand or need now? Is it a new prophet, a new messiah, a new world redeemer? No, not in the sense that these words have been used in the past. Everyone who stands up today and says that he is a new Christ or a new messiah belongs without exception to the category that Jesus regarded as the false prophets that would come. What a new world needs is not more religious dogmas. The greatest truths in the form of dogmas have been preached for thousands of years, consequently anyone who comes who is only able to give people these same dogmas would be a mere plagiarist of the real messiah or Christ. And if he then also demands that one should believe blindly in him and follow him, his identity as a false Christ would be quite apparent to anyone who really has high-intellectual insight into the highest phenomena of life. He would then not be the fulfilment of the promise that Christ prophesied would come. For Christ did not prophesy a new leader or spiritual dictator, but a highintellectual analysis of life’s greatest problems or the solution to the mystery of life itself in such a way that every human being becomes its own Christ. Such an analysis is nothing other than the “holy spirit”.” Quoted from “Spiritual science” – English Kosmos No. 2 – 2000.</div>

        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>This main symbol weaves together the analyses from symbols 8, 9 and 10. Here these three eternal principles appear as an indivisible unit, which is shown by the fact that the disks from symbols 8, 9 and 10 are now laid one on top of the other. The universe is an eternal living being – God – that gives expression to itself through 6 different planes of existence. These are built up of life within life as we saw in symbol 7.<br /> <br />The white star and the field radiating outwards from the centre symbolise the Godhead, while the many white circles and the rays that emanate from them express the individual living beings – the sons of God. One can see from the symbol how life is made up of an interaction or conversation relayed by Nature between the Godhead and the sons of God. The 6 planes of existence where this takes place (the stage of the theatre of life) are each marked with their own colour: red – the plant kingdom, orange – the animal kingdom, yellow – the true human kingdom, green – the kingdom of wisdom, blue – the divine world, light indigo – the kingdom of bliss. (These kingdoms will be described in detail in symbol 13.) The living beings journey again and again through these kingdoms in an upwards-moving spiral (see symbol 14). In the symbol the Earth is placed level with the animal kingdom. It is on its own journey to cosmic consciousness and can therefore offer mankind, which is travelling the same road, a place to live. All living beings will gain cosmic consciousness, which is indicated by the small star. This “cosmic birth” is the introduction to the true human kingdom, and we are already experiencing the first signs of the coming of this kingdom on Earth. This process will be fully completed in less than 3,000 years. After that the road continues through the higher spiritual kingdoms, which are in reality one kingdom with several sections.</div>]]></explanation>

        <titel><![CDATA[The evolution of cosmic consciousness]]></titel>
        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>The symbol shows the cosmic road that all living beings are travelling from lesser to more evolved forms of existence. In the symbol one can see, indicated by the light indigo colour on the left, “the kingdom of bliss”. It is the last part of this kingdom that we are able to observe on the physical plane as the mineral kingdom. Next, with the red colour, comes “the plant kingdom”, with the orange colour, “the animal kingdom” and with the yellow colour, “the kingdom of the perfect human being” of the future. The vertical line in the middle of the animal kingdom divides the pure animal kingdom from the sphere of the unfinished terrestrial human beings. Each of the three-part vertical segments symbolises a living being. The segments which are increasing in size thus symbolise the multitude of incarnations that any one being lives through on this road. The number shown is purely symbolic. For example, there are hundreds of incarnations for ape-like organisms. The white field at the top symbolises the I or “X1”. The violet field symbolises the being’s eternal cosmic structure, “X2”, that together with the I forms its super consciousness. The coloured field symbolises the created physical organism and consciousness, “X3”. The orange star with the green and yellow-green rays symbolises, with the green ray, the research undertaken by natural science into that part of life that can be observed with the physical senses, and with the yellow-green ray, philosophy that brings about an ongoing movement inwards towards what is spiritual – without certainty of knowledge. The yellow ray at the top symbolises the religious principle that leads human beings from faith and irreligiousness on to a personal experience of cosmic consciousness, marked by the five-pointed star. In its position above, the religious principle relates to the eternal and spiritual part of the human beings’ identity. Myths and symbols from terrestrial human beings’ religious past thus conceal undiscovered real cosmic truths.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The position of the Earth in the symbol relates to mankind’s evolutionary step at the end of the animal kingdom. In the little symbol at the bottom the sun symbolises the cosmically conscious being and its sensory capacity, which encompasses both the eternal and the created or temporal part of the universe. The lowest small triangle symbolises the unfinished human being and its extremely limited sensory capacity (see next symbol).</div>]]></explanation>

        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>The cosmic journey of the living beings is really a journey through higher and higher cycles with no end. For this reason they are called “spiral cycles”.<br /> </div>
<div>On the symbol we can see 7 of these spiral cycles marked with the letters:<br /> </div>
<div>A – the spiral of atoms/matter and such like.</div>
<div>B – the spiral of cell beings and such like.</div>
<div>C – the spiral of organ beings and such like.</div>
<div>D – our own spiral/mesocosmos.</div>

        <titel><![CDATA[“An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”]]></titel>
        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>
<div>The Bible has predicted a “time of tribulation” with “distress”, “fear”, “wars and rumours of wars” (Mat. 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, John 14-16). These words and many more, seem to be perfectly suitable to the times that we are living in. In these times the Bible’s message of love should, according to Christ, be explained: “the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you” (John 14:26).</div>
<div>This promised “Counsellor, the Holy Spirit” is therefore a conclusive, firm, scientific explanation of Jesus’ teachings about love. It is knowledge about the spiritual reality behind the physical world revealed to the modern, humane, intellectual human being – is Martinus’ work, The Third Testament this Counsellor? The row of orange and yellow rectangles at the bottom of the symbol show the process of reincarnation from one terrestrial life to another (orange), broken by stays in the spiritual worlds (yellow). In this case the being is receiving dark karma, symbolised by the large orange arc coming from the left and the sword through the heart (the organism). In this case the living being (the white triangle) is responding by using the sword i.e. the “principle of revenge”. It does not know that with this action it is binding itself to the zone of the culmination of darkness, where one is not so aware of the keynote of the universe, love (symbolised by the radiance behind the skeleton). The dark part of karma is, however, not a punishment from God. Through darkness, terrestrial human beings learn to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate actions. Darkness is an initiation that renders terrestrial human beings able to feel compassion and humaneness and leads them to knowledge of God.</div>
<div><br />The sea of flames symbolises war, revolution, unrest, strikes, lockouts, political struggle, religious conflict, poverty, illness and distress. The volcano symbolises natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods and cyclones etc. and thereby also the state of suffering to which terrestrial human beings sometimes subject the microbeings in their own body. Through one’s actions towards one’s own microcosmos one also creates effects in one’s fate that return through macrocosmos, and vice versa.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Not until one has been “defeated” a sufficient number of times will the truth behind the words of Jesus to “love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you” begin to dawn. It is in the darkness that the light is born.</div>

        <titel><![CDATA[“Go, and sin no more”]]></titel>
        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>Jesus taught with power and authority using miracles, symbols and in particular through example. This was the only way that believers could approach the eternal truths behind life. For a very long time the ways of God had been “past understanding” to terrestrial human beings; they lacked the abilities to understand the eternal truths behind Jesus’ words. But since terrestrial human beings have eaten the “apples of knowledge”, the speech of life has made many terrestrial human beings able to begin to understand for themselves the ways of God. And how else would they “become like God, knowing good and evil”?</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Bible describes how Jesus forgave the sins of people who experienced that they had fallen from God’s grace. The symbol explains how the forgiveness of sins that Jesus spoke about actually does exist. Slowly we become freed from the dark karma that we have built up – the suffering that we have created for other beings. This takes place through the humane faculty (the yellow flame) growing from life to life (every time we reap suffering). This humane faculty protects us – in fact it is the only protection we have, from a cosmic point of view. The orange steps symbolise the being’s individual earthly lives in the past (yellow) and in the future (green). The violet field symbolises the being’s super consciousness and consequently its eternal life. The orange rectangles symbolise the succession of the being’s earthly lives – reincarnation. The orange fate wave is set in motion by a selfish action, e.g. a murder that is committed in the being’s present life (between the vertical white beams). When this action returns to its originator, this being might possibly experience being killed. The unpleasant fate develops the being’s body of feeling and it becomes more humane. This takes many, many incarnations, but, as is symbolised by the growth of the yellow flame, the being can at a certain point no longer bear to commit the same selfish action and it will experience only the injuries that it can still bear to inflict on other beings – until it is completely cleansed and “humane”. It then no longer needs to learn about darkness. Its loving radiation protects it and the dark karma can no longer be released in the being’s life. It has therefore truly obtained the “forgiveness of sins”. The white fate waves show that fate formation also takes place in the spiritual world between lives, and that this can only be light and happy in nature.</div>]]></explanation>

        <explanation><![CDATA[<p>In The Old Testament it is described how God made known to human beings the aim of creation: “Let us make man in our image after our likeness” (Gen. 1:26). Jesus demonstrated the behaviour and way of being of such a finished human being. His words and behaviour have been preserved in the Bible for posterity. The world has been given an example of the aim of creation and evolution. He was able to demonstrate humane behaviour towards his persecutors. While he himself was being crucified he could pray for them with the words: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34). These are the actions of the finished human being in the image of the allloving God.</p>
<div>In the symbol the two clasped hands show how such a loving being responds to darkness and “hostility” (the large orange arc) with friendship. This reaction creates the yellow, humane arc of karma, which will later return to the being itself in the form of light and joy. It is this behaviour that will lead mankind out of the darkness (symbolised by the clouds), which is supplanted by the light from God (the radiant triangle) through world redemption (the radiant star surrounding it). Through a process of evolution from one life to another, symbolised by the small orange, circulararcs that the being has created and is then given back, karma (the circular arcs) gradually gives rise to more and more humaneness (yellow colour). The yellow/orange rectangular fields symbolise the individual terrestrial lives and these are separated by periods spent in the spiritual world (the light yellow fields). Terrestrial human beings’ steadily increasing awareness of their conscience shows that they are on their way to the state of being all-loving. Eventually they will only be able to bear to do good, like the Christ being in the symbol.</div>]]></explanation>

        <titel><![CDATA[“In my Father’s house are many mansions”]]></titel>
        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>According to The Third Testament, the physical part of the universe is equal to God’s physical organism, and “behind” the “empty space” of the universe is God’s consciousness and infinite I. God’s all-inclusive organism is built up of life within life without end. This once again confirms the words in the Bible: “In my Father’s house are many mansions”. Our organism is also built up of living beings, which we call organs, cells, molecules, atoms etc. If these beings, from our sensory perspective, are very far away we call them “matter”. The Earth is also a living individual, in the same way that the life-giving sun, the solar system and the Milky Way are living beings. One could say: “As above, so below”. All living beings are cells or experiencing organs in God’s organism. This makes the everyday life of all living beings a conversation with God.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What we do to our neighbour, we do to God. “The speech of life” is God’s way of answering, which we eternally receive through our neighbour. This neighbour constitutes the beings in “our own” body as well as the planet being that we inhabit. When one understands that life in the microworld is just as living as we are ourselves, there appears a new, and hitherto unknown, area of responsibility where the message of love also applies. The way we conduct funerals will therefore also change. Cremation will be replaced by more humane methods that take into consideration the myriads of living microbeings in the “corpse”. Only when the mineral state has been reached are there no longer in the “corpse” any microbeings that are alive and experiencing physically. Love for animals as well as for the microbeings will also bring about a change from animal to vegetarian food (see symbol 38) and cause people to think about light living conditions, fresh air, hygiene, sleep patterns and care of the body. The symbol shows a being’s organism in its entirety. (The triangle and the white circle symbolise its X1 and X2 respectively.) The figure is built up of smaller figures. This symbolises that the organism is made up of living microindividuals each one with its own ability to experience. This is repeated upwards and down-wards into infinity. In this way we are also contained within macrocosmos which consists of larger and larger organisms, for example, the Earth, the solar system, the galaxy/Milky Way – continuing for ever. The macrobeing provides us with our outer living environment (Nature) while the microbeings provide us with our physical organism. At one and the same time everything consists of a unity. “In him we live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28).</div>]]></explanation>

        <titel><![CDATA[The kingdom of the sphinx]]></titel>
        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>The general world situation is characterised by nationalism i.e. the animal’s instinct of self preservation manifested as collective egoism. This tendency inherited from the animal kingdom characterises the relationships between human beings as well as between nations. In the animal kingdom might is right.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nations strive after might using both military and economic power. The symbol shows the Earth with its many nations. These are symbolised by the various red fields. These can be seen in a way of organs that have still not learnt how to cooperate ideally in the Earth’s organism. In each field there is a white circle with an arrow which represents the government of the country. The arrows are pointing in different directions.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The orange stars symbolise the materialistic and warlike ideals and actions that dominate the thinking of certain nations. A nation can create war and suffering despite declaring its intentions to have Christian ideals.</div>
<div>The warring parties are thus united in their warlike ideals, which belong to the principle of  vengeance, described in the law of Moses as “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”. In like manner, this principle of vengeance is also adopted internally in the nation’s legal system. Collectively the “killing principle” is symbolised by the orange colour (the energy of gravity). In the upper third of the symbol the arrows are more or less pointing away from these warlike ideals and up towards the rays that, together with the white star, symbolise the truly humane ideals that are already beginning to find expression in the government policies of certain countries. The number, placing or dividing up of the fields should not be interpreted literally or geographically – humane societies are now emerging in more and more places around the globe.</div>]]></explanation>

        <titel><![CDATA[The united states of the world, “one shepherd and one flock”]]></titel>
        <explanation><![CDATA[<div>The countries of the world are being brought steadily closer together. Communication, infrastructure, distribution, economics etc. is developed and adapted to global dimensions.</div>
<div>More and more nations realise that in order to obtain global peace, political stability and wellbeing for all people on Earth, ratifiable, international laws and agreements are needed.</div>
<div>We are becoming more dependent on each other. The dilemma of the great world events is this: should the interest of the nation be at the cost of the world community or should the nation be of service to the whole? Selfishness undermines itself – when seen in a cosmic light. The culmination of darkness leads to consequences that reveal it for what it is in all its aspects. This concerns not least the extensive misuse of money through the “false business principle”, which enables people, perfectly lawfully, to obtain by deception something of greater value in exchange for something of lesser value. World wars and other manifestations of fate make it clear that the happiness or misery of the whole of humankind is the same as our own happiness or misery. The constancy of eternal cosmic laws guides everyone towards unselfishness. The nations will realize that they have no other choice than to co-operate as the world state that has ostensibly already begun to function under the name of the UN. Neighbourly love and internationalism are the solution to the intense crises that are found all over the world. In this way the words in the Bible about one shepherd and one flock are fulfilled – one people with one God and one true religion. This is shown in the symbol by the fact that the Earth has moved completely into the light emanating from the new world impulse – the white colour. The previous ideas about religion (the yellow and orange) will fade away in favour of knowledge of God and thereafter the development of those faculties that make it possible to create in physical matter the kingdom of heaven on Earth. The nations of the Earth (the white circles) and their governments (the arrows) will become regions in the world state, each one with its own distinctive character (the green fields). The yellow sun in the centre symbolises the world government, that initially will be supervised by humankind’s highest representatives in their own special field of competence and responsibility, these people being elected by everyone who is old enough to vote. Eventually this government can be made up of cosmic conscious beings (the blue star). Other factors include:</div>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>Disarmament – the world state will have no outward enemies and will need only a world police force to guarantee internal law and order.<br /><br /></li>
<li>An open, not secret, supreme judicial system.<br /><br /></li>
<li>A judicial system that is able to recognize the difference between criminality and abnormality and will use humane educational methods instead of punishment and sentencing.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The abolition of money and the private ownership of natural resources.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The introduction of receipts for having done a certain amount of work to replace money as a means of payment.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The formation of a fund to pay for the periods of childhood, old age and illness.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The introduction of machines to carry out the coarse work.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The development of vegetarianism, art and spirit.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Whereas previously might ruled over right, it is now right which settles all issues; the world state is therefore guided by intellectualised feeling and humanised intelligence, which is the same as neighbourly love.</li>
</ul>]]></explanation>
